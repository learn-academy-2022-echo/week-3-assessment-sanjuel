# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is what you use when you are in React, it lets you utilize JavaScript in react and blend it into HTML. One difference is the fact that you need JSX fragments in html to use Javascript.

Researched answer: JSX is often viewed as the merging of HTML and JavaScript, allowing a person to write both of the languages simultainously. JSX allows a person to, in React, add JavaScript to your HTML tags, though using things like props and components. A core syntactical difference between HTML and JSX is that you need fragment tags to indicate that you are goign to be using JavaScript. An example of why this is useful is in components. They allow you to re use code and make it so that you no longer have to type the same thing over and over again to get the same result. A fun fact about JSX is that it is considered "syntactical sugar" for React. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is what allows you to test your javscript code with Jest. We use it to make sure our code is doing what we expect it to do. When you run yarn, you get the yarn.lock file. 

Researched answer: Yarn is a software packaging system that was created by facebook for JavaScript. A software packaging system is something that allows you to install and manage software packages, which are what makes up the core of something like React. When you run yarn, you get node modules and the yarn.lock file, which allow yarn to work. A fun fact about node modules is that they weigh more than the sun. 

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function in JavaScript is one that can be run without showing up in a console log. 

Researched answer: An anonymous function in JavaScript is one that exists without a name. usually in JavaScript every piece of code is assosiated with a variable, so that we can keep calling on that variable to do something, but in the case of an anonymous function, it has no name. These are often used when invoking higher order function like .map or .filter. 

4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class is a blueprint for an object, so they are related but not the same. 

Researched answer: A class is a blueprint for an object. This means that a class will define what an object is, giving it different information to go off of. An object is the data or values inside of the class. In this way, an object is created by its class. An object would be a desk, and the class is how to build that desk. 

5. What is the difference between state and props in React?

Your answer: State is how something is right at that one moment, and props is how we inject a component into our main app file in React. 

Researched answer: The difference between state and props in React is that state is defined in your App.js file, and gives your code a default state, as well as place to store changes. This is why it is called "state", as it is in a way a state of being for your code. Props are used in components, which are seperate from your main App.js file but still connected by component calls and props. This allows your code to communicate between components and the main file. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div is a break in an html or react file, a span is... something else that isnt that .

Researched answer: The difference between a div and a span is that a div is a HTML element that is used to seperate and organize different elements, like headers or paragraph tags, while a span element is for an individual tag that allows you to change one thing. For example, a span can be used in a header to change one thing about just that header. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object oriented programming is programming that relies on classes and objects. I know that JavaScript is mostly made up of objects and classes, so I'd assume those two things are related. 

2. Ruby: Ruby is a programming language where everything is an object. This language focuses on simplicity and programming productivity.

3. Implicit return: An implicit return is the idea that there is an assumed return in a function without having to type it yourself. 

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions, which are functions without names, that are passed into methods. 

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hashes are data that can be used to store data in the form of key value pairs.
